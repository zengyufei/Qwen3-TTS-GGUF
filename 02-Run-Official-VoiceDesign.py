Character Name: Marcus Cole
Voice Profile: A bright, agile male voice with a natural upward lift, delivering lines at a brisk, energetic pace. Pitch leans high with spark, volume projects clearly—near-shouting at peaks—to convey urgency and excitement. Speech flows seamlessly, fluently, each word sharply defined, riding a current of dynamic rhythm.
Background: Longtime broadcast booth announcer for national television, specializing in live interstitials and public engagement spots. His voice bridges segments, rallies action, and keeps momentum alive—from voter drives to entertainment news.
Presence: Late 50s, neatly groomed, dressed in a crisp shirt under studio lights. Moves with practiced ease, eyes locked on the script, energy coiled and ready.
Personality: Energetic, precise, inherently engaging. He doesn’t just read—he propels. Behind the speed is intent: to inform fast, to move people to act. Whether it’s “text VOTE to 5703” or a star-studded tease, he makes it feel immediate, vital.
